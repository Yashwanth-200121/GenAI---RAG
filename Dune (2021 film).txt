Dune (titled onscreen as Dune: Part One) is a 2021 American epic science fiction film directed and co-produced by Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth. It is the first of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. Set in the distant future, the film follows Paul Atreides as his family, the noble House Atreides, is thrust into a war for the deadly and inhospitable desert planet Arrakis. The ensemble cast includes Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem.

The film is the third adaptation of Dune, following David Lynch's 1984 film and John Harrison's 2000 television miniseries. After an unsuccessful attempt by Paramount Pictures to produce a new adaptation, Legendary Pictures acquired the Dune film and television rights in 2016, with Villeneuve signing on as director in February 2017. Production contracts were secured only for the first film, relying on its success before a sequel would be produced. Principal photography took place from March to July 2019 at locations including Budapest, Jordan, Norway, and Abu Dhabi.

Dune was scheduled for a late 2020 release but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2021, before its international release on September 15, 2021; it was then released in United States theaters and streaming on HBO Max on October 22, 2021. Dune grossed $407.6 million on a $165 million budget. It was well received by critics and audiences with praise for Villeneuve's direction, screenplay, the performances of the cast, production values, costumes, Hans Zimmer's musical score, cinematography, and retaining core elements from the source material. The film won six awards at the 94th Academy Awards and was nominated in four other categories; it received numerous other accolades. A sequel, Dune: Part Two, was released on March 1, 2024, with another sequel based on Herbert's 1969 novel Dune Messiah currently in development.

Plot
In the distant future, Duke Leto Atreides is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to replace Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as the fiefholder of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet and the sole source of "spice", a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Spice is also key to interstellar travel, giving Spacing Guild Navigators the ability to guide starships to traverse space instantaneously and safely. Emperor Shaddam, fearful of Leto's rising power, plots for House Harkonnen to retake Arrakis, secretly aided by his Sardaukar troops, and destroy House Atreides. Leto is suspicious of the Emperor, but weighs the risks against the power of controlling Arrakis and making an alliance with its mysterious natives, the Fremen.

Leto's concubine, Lady Jessica, is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit—an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of a centuries-long breeding program, they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach—a Bene Gesserit and messianic superbeing with the clairvoyance necessary to guide humanity to a better future. Jessica disobeyed and bore a son, Paul, who is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, and she teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions of the future. The Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam subjects Paul to a deadly gom jabbar test to assess his humanity and impulse control, which he passes.

House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, the principal stronghold on Arrakis. Duncan's advance party has made contact with the Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica, which she explains is due to the Bene Gesserit sowing beliefs on Arrakis centuries earlier. An attempt to assassinate Paul with a hunter-seeker fails. At a secret meeting on the Harkonnen planet Giedi Prime, Mohiam insists Baron Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica in his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees.

Leto meets and negotiates with Fremen chieftain Stilgar and meets the Imperial Judge of the Change, Dr. Liet Kynes, a planetologist who lives among the Fremen. Kynes briefs them on the dangers of spice harvesting, and the giant sandworms that travel under the desert and render unwise the use of protective shields. During a flight, they rescue a stranded spice-harvesting crew from a sandworm, and Paul's exposure to the spice triggers intense premonitions.

Yueh betrays the Atreides and disables Arrakeen's shields, allowing the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to invade. He incapacitates Leto, planning to exchange him for his wife, the Baron's prisoner. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule with which the Duke can assassinate the Baron. After the Baron double-crosses and murders Yueh, Leto releases the gas, killing himself and the Baron's Mentat, Piter De Vries, but the Baron survives. Though the Baron has arranged to have Paul and Jessica dropped deep in the desert to die, a compassionate Yueh has left them with a fremkit with survival supplies. Jessica uses a Bene Gesserit technique called "the Voice" to overpower and kill their captors. Overnighting in the desert, Paul—surrounded by spice—has visions of a bloody holy war fought across the universe in his name.

After conquering Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen appoints his nephew Rabban to oversee the planet, and orders him to restart spice production to recoup the invasion's cost. Meanwhile, Duncan and Kynes find Jessica and Paul, who discloses his plan to marry one of Emperor Shaddam's daughters to avert a potential civil war arising from the Emperor's betrayal. They are discovered by Sardaukar soldiers armed with a lasgun, and Duncan sacrifices himself, enabling Paul and Jessica's escape. Kynes also tries to escape but is caught and mortally wounded, and lures a sandworm to her location to devour herself and the Sardaukar. Deep in the desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar's Fremen tribe, including Chani, the young woman from Paul's visions. Despite Stilgar's lenience towards them, Fremen warrior Jamis challenges Paul to a ritual duel to the death, which Paul wins. Contrary to Jessica's wishes, Paul joins the Fremen, determined to fulfill his father's goal of bringing peace to Arrakis.

Production
Background
Since the publication of Frank Herbert's Dune in 1965, there have been multiple attempts to adapt the novel into film. Initial efforts were hampered by the novel's complexity and the potential risks of deviating from the source material.

In the 1970s, Alejandro Jodorowsky acquired the adaptation rights and aimed to create a fourteen-hour film, but the project failed due to funding issues, later documented in Jodorowsky's Dune (2013). David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation, produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis, was originally planned as a three-hour film but was reduced to 137 minutes and received poor reviews, leading Lynch to disown it.

In 1996, Richard P. Rubinstein acquired the rights and produced a live-action miniseries, which aired on the Sci Fi Channel in 2000. It was better received than Lynch's film but criticized for its lack of spectacle and heavy exposition.

The success of adaptations like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter improved the prospects for Dune. In 2008, Paramount Pictures hired Peter Berg to direct an adaptation, but he left in 2009. Pierre Morel was hired in 2010, but the project was canceled in 2011, with the rights reverting to Rubinstein.


Writing
Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune was planned as a two-part film series, inspired by the two-part adaptation of Stephen King's It. Villeneuve chose this approach due to the novel's complexity, aiming to stay true to the book rather than draw inspiration from previous adaptations by David Lynch or Alejandro Jodorowsky. He sought to respect Lynch's film while creating his own vision, which he described as a process of "archaeology" to bring the book's imagery and emotions to life.

Villeneuve viewed the screenplay as both a coming-of-age story and a critique of capitalism and resource exploitation. He made several changes for the film, including removing internal monologues, simplifying dialogue, and focusing on the relationship between Paul and Jessica. The political elements of the Dune universe were downplayed to emphasize Paul's growth.

Some characters, like Baron Harkonnen and the Mentats, were given less prominence but set up for future developments. Villeneuve aimed to portray the Baron as a more nuanced antagonist and revised female character arcs to better reflect their roles, enhancing Lady Jessica's character beyond the book's depiction.


Design
For the film adaptation of Dune, production designer Patrice Vermette and costume designers Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan created detailed and immersive designs to bring Frank Herbert's novel to life.

Set and Props:
Set Design: Vermette aimed for realism and immersion, using minimal set extensions and no greenscreens. He created a "visual bible" and re-read the novel to guide the set design. Influences included Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and brutalist architecture. Key sets included Caladan, designed with autumnal tones and medieval Japanese aesthetics, and Arrakeen, influenced by WWII bunkers and Mayan temples. The sandworm design was inspired by tree bark and mud flats, and ornithopters were crafted to resemble dragonflies and helicopters.

Props: Practical sets were built at Origo Film Studios in Budapest. Ornithopters were functional models weighing over 11 tons. The sandworm design aimed to reflect its revered status among the Fremen, and Arrakeen was designed to withstand sandworms and high winds.

Costumes:
General Design: Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan designed over 1000 costumes, drawing from historical and symbolic references. West incorporated elements from the Middle Ages, French Resistance, and various artistic influences, while the Fremen and Sardaukar costumes drew from historical and cultural analogs.

Specific Designs: The Bene Gesserit costumes were inspired by tarot cards and chess pieces, Harkonnen armor resembled insect shells, and Atreides outfits had a regal simplicity. Lady Jessica’s costumes featured influences from Balenciaga and Middle Eastern clothing. Stillsuits were designed for flexibility and comfort, with a focus on accuracy to the book and practical functionality for desert filming conditions.

Music
Hans Zimmer composed the score for Dune, marking his collaboration with director Denis Villeneuve, whom he previously worked with on Blade Runner 2049. Zimmer, who declined to score Christopher Nolan’s Tenet due to his personal connection to Dune, aimed to create a distinctive soundtrack by using unconventional instruments and avoiding influences from past adaptations. He recorded unique sounds from the Utah desert and utilized eclectic instruments, including bagpipes for the House Atreides theme, recorded with 30 players in Edinburgh during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zimmer also supervised a choir remotely for the first trailer’s cover of Pink Floyd’s "Eclipse". Three soundtrack albums were released in 2021, including The Dune Sketchbook, Dune (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), and The Art and Soul of Dune. Zimmer’s innovative work was praised by Villeneuve, and the score was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.


Box office
Dune grossed $108.9 million in the US and Canada and $298.7 million internationally, totaling $407.6 million worldwide during its initial release. The film exceeded opening weekend projections with $41 million from 4,125 theaters, making it the highest opening for Warner Bros. in the pandemic era and the best of Denis Villeneuve's career. It experienced significant drops in subsequent weekends but became the second Warner Bros. film of the pandemic era to surpass $100 million in the US and Canada.

Internationally, the film earned $37.9 million from 14 markets on its opening weekend and added $26.3 million from 32 countries in its second weekend. It performed well in China, earning $21.6 million during its opening weekend but saw a decline in later weeks. The film crossed $300 million globally by November 2, 2021, and reached the $400 million mark by February 14, 2022. Notable international grosses included $39.5 million in China, $32.6 million in France, $30 million in the UK, $22.5 million in Germany, and $21.3 million in Russia. 

Sequels and spin-offs
Denis Villeneuve planned a two-part adaptation of Dune, and by November 2019, Jon Spaihts left his role as showrunner of Dune: Prophecy to focus on the sequel. Warner Bros. initially expressed concerns about the film's financial performance due to the simultaneous HBO Max release caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could affect the sequel's production. Despite this, the sequel, Dune: Part Two, was officially greenlit in October 2021 after the first film's success. Filming for the sequel began in Italy in July 2022 and concluded by December, with a release date set for March 1, 2024. The film's world premiere is scheduled for February 15, 2024.

Villeneuve expressed interest in adapting Dune Messiah and developing a third film, contingent on the success of Dune: Part Two. He started working on the script in 2023, aiming for high quality over speed. Hans Zimmer was already composing music for the potential third film.

In June 2019, Legendary Television announced Dune: The Sisterhood, a prequel series focusing on the Bene Gesserit for HBO Max. Initially, Villeneuve was set to direct the pilot, with Spaihts writing the screenplay. By November 2019, Spaihts left the series to focus on the sequel, but he and Villeneuve stayed on as executive producers. Diane Ademu-John took over as showrunner in July 2021, with Johan Renck directing the first two episodes. However, production was paused in February 2023, and the series was rebranded as Dune: Prophecy in November 2023.

Plot
In the late 1990s, Pushpa Raj, a laborer, gets involved in smuggling red sandalwood with his friend Kesava. Rising through the ranks in Konda Reddy's smuggling group, Pushpa impresses the Reddy brothers but faces sabotage from Jaali, Konda's jealous younger brother. Despite Jaali’s schemes, Pushpa evades the police and learns that Srinu, their boss, is cheating the workers. When Konda refuses to challenge Srinu, Pushpa takes matters into his own hands, bypassing Srinu and securing higher profits.

Pushpa falls in love with Srivalli, but his illegitimate birth is exposed during their engagement, motivating him to climb the smuggling ranks. Jaali blackmails Srivalli, but Pushpa confronts him, leaving Jaali paralyzed. Konda tries to kill Pushpa but is murdered by Srinu’s brother-in-law, Mogileesu. Pushpa avenges Konda by killing Mogileesu and eventually takes over Srinu's position, thanks to support from MLA Naidu.

Bhanwar Singh Shekawat replaces DSP Govindappa and clashes with Pushpa, belittling him for his arrogance. Pushpa, however, plays submissive until his wedding day, when he humiliates Shekawat by forcing him to strip down, proving that Shekawat’s power is tied only to his uniform. Pushpa marries Srivalli and declares that his reign has just begun. A furious Shekawat, after being humiliated, kills his own dog and vows revenge on Pushpa.

Production
Development
Post the success of Rangasthalam (2018), Sukumar narrated a script to Mahesh Babu, with whom he previously worked in 1: Nenokkadine (2014).[15] Babu, who liked the story, gave a nod to the project,[15] and was reported to start the shoot after completing Vamshi Paidipally's project Maharshi (2019).[15] In mid-April 2018, Mythri Movie Makers, which collaborated with Sukumar in their previous film Rangasthalam, officially announced the project which was tentatively titled as #SSMB26, thus marking their second collaboration with Babu and Sukumar. The film was expected to begin in January 2019, but, in that March, Babu walked out of Sukumar's project citing creative differences, and he confirmed this through Twitter.[17][18] The actor instead signed his next project with Anil Ravipudi titled as Sarileru Neekevvaru, whereas Sukumar approached Allu Arjun for his next film, marking his reunion with the director after a decade since Arya 2 (2009).

Pre-production
The plot revolves around the smuggling of red sandalwood (image pictured).
Sukumar described the storyline as follows: "the red sanders heist in the hills of Andhra is a convoluted nexus that unfurls in the course of the narrative through a coolie-turned-smuggler."[24] Sukumar explored the subject of red sandalwood smuggling when he read about such incidents in Andhra Pradesh years ago. Sukumar did his research and thought of developing the project as a web series. However, he later decided to make it as a feature film.[25] He personally went for location scouting across Nallamala Hills as the film is set in Rayalaseema and Nellore and the plot revolves around red sanders smuggling.[26] Since most of the film takes place in a rural backdrop, Allu Arjun was reported to have learned the Chittoor accent for the film,[27] and the makers hired a team from Bollywood to work on his look.[27] The story is set against the backdrop of Seshachalam forest, located in the hilly region of Tirumala.[26] Polish cinematographer Miroslaw Kuba Brozek, who worked for Nani's Gangleader (2019) was signed for the film. Karthika Srinivas performed the film's editing, whereas Mounika and Ramakrishna, the art directors of Sukumar's previous film Rangasthalam (2018) were chosen for production design.[28] Resul Pookutty signed for the film's sound design, along with Vijay Kumar.[29] The film's title Pushpa was officially announced on 8 April 2020, on the occasion of Allu Arjun's birthday and a poster was also released.[30]

Casting
Allu Arjun played the titular character Pushpa Raj, a red-sanders smuggler, and sported a bearded look for his role in the film.[31] Rashmika Mandanna was cast as the film's lead actress,[32] with an official announcement made on Allu Arjun's birthday (8 April 2019).[33] Mandanna in an online interaction confirmed that she will be learning a new dialect for the film, like Arjun, which is slightly based on the dialect of Chittoor.[34][35] Jisshu Sengupta was originally offered to play the antagonist but he refused due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and time constraints.[36][37] Vijay Sethupathi entered talks to play the antagonist in October 2019, having worked with Sukumar in the director's production venture Uppena (2021),[38][39] and was confirmed to be part of the film in January 2020.[40] However, in July 2020, Sethupathi left the film citing scheduling conflicts.[41] Post Sethupathi's exit, Vikram,[42] Bobby Simha,[43] Madhavan[44] and Arya[45] were reported to be playing negative roles in the film, but ultimately Malayalam actor Fahadh Faasil was announced as the film's antagonist in March 2021, thus marking his debut in Telugu cinema.[46] For his role in the film, Fahadh sported a bald look and a rough moustache.[47]

Kannada actor Dhananjaya was reported to be playing a pivotal role in April 2020.[48] In November 2020, Sunil was cast in a supporting role and was present in the film's second schedule.[49] Sunil's character was reported to have grey shades in the film.[45] Though it was reported that Anasuya Bharadwaj was playing a crucial role, she later clarified that she wasn't approached for the film.[50] However, Bharadwaj joined the film's shooting in April 2021.[51] In July 2021, Sritej confirmed that he was cast in the role of Pushpa Raj's brother.[52] The film had three antagonists, with Sunil and Anasuya, being the antagonists in the first part,[53][54] while Fahadh's character, Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat, the main antagonist, will appear only at the end of the first part and will continue throughout its sequel.[55] Jagadeesh was cast by Sukumar after he watched his performances in the films Mallesham (2019) and George Reddy (2019).[56] In an interview, Jagadeesh Prathap Bandari revealed that he had left 15 smaller projects for working in the film.[57] Samantha joined the production in late-November 2021. She shot for the item song "Oo Antava Oo Oo Antava" alongside Allu Arjun and others.[58][59] On working in the song, she said that "being sexy is next level hard work".[60]

Filming
In July 2019, the makers planned to start filming during the occasion of Dusshera (7 October 2019).[61] However, the launch event of the film took place on 30 October 2019,[62] with a formal puja ceremony (muhurat shot) held in Hyderabad at the office of Mythri Movie Makers,[63] with the film's cast and crew being present at the event.[64][65] In December 2019, Sukumar performed a test shoot in Kerala's Athirappilly Falls.[66] After Allu Arjun's involvement in the promotions of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020),[27] the makers planned to shoot the first schedule of the film in Kerala in March 2020, with Arjun joining the schedule, however, the filming was halted due to COVID-19 pandemic in India.[67]


Majority of the film was shot in Maredumilli, Andhra Pradesh
For a 6-minute action sequence in the film, the team planned to hire action choreographers from South India, instead of opting for foreign technicians.[68] Thus, the film became a "Make In India" project, and an initiative to provide employment to the workers from the Indian film industry, after some technicians faced employment crisis due to the pandemic.[citation needed] This sequence was reported to be made a cost of ₹6 crore (US$720,000) and Allu Arjun trained intensively for it.[69][68]

In June 2020, the makers planned to resume the shoot at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad,[70] and later planned to shoot the film at Nalgonda.[71] After the government permitted film shootings with a minimal crew,[72] the makers resumed filming on 10 November 2020 in the Maredumilli forest in Andhra Pradesh,[24][73] and completed it within 14 days.[74] The team then moved to Rajahmundry in December 2020 to shoot key sequences, but that was postponed to January 2021, as twelve crew members working on the film were diagnosed with COVID-19.[75][76] The shooting later resumed in January 2021 and the production house tweeted that two schedules at Rampachodavaram and Maredumilli were completed within February 2021.[77] The team also finished a schedule at Kerala in March 2021.[78]

Post-production
The dubbing of the film began in April 2021.[92] Ten days before the release of the film, Shreyas Talpade confirmed that he has dubbed for Allu Arjun for the film's Hindi version.[93] Jis Joy who has dubbed for Arjun's previous films in Malayalam, was signed to dub for Allu Arjun for the Malayalam version,[94] and by the early-December 2021 he had completed his portions of the dubbing.[95] K. P. Sekar lent Allu Arjun's voice for the film's Tamil version.[96] Fahadh Faasil has dubbed for his role in all the languages,[97] except Hindi which was dubbed by Rajesh Khattar.

Release
Theatrical
Pushpa: The Rise was released on 17 December 2021.[100][101] Previously, the film was announced to release on 13 August 2021, coinciding with the Independence Day weekend.[102] In May 2021, the makers announced that the film would be releasing in two parts, with the first part coming on the originally intended release date while the second installment will be arriving in 2023. The producers released a statement saying: "The storyline and the characters took on lives of their own and grew to a span that required the movie to be released in two parts",[103] and the title of the film's first part was unveiled as Pushpa: The Rise – Part 1 in August 2021.[104] Due to a surge in the COVID-19 pandemic, the film's release was rescheduled to Christmas 2021.[105] In October 2021, the makers announced the release date as 17 December 2021.[101][106][107] It simultaneously released in Telugu and dubbed versions in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi languages.[108][109]

Following the release, the makers deleted a controversial scene on fans' demand as they felt it may not go well with the family audience. In the scene, Pushpa (played by Arjun) touches Srivalli's (played by Mandanna) chest and has a conversation about it. It is also reported that a few more scenes were cut to reduce its runtime.[110][111]

In later half of 2022, it got officially dubbed in Russian, the production company released Russian-language trailer on YouTube on 29 November 2022 and the film was released in theatres of Russia.[112] The film was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival in 2022. It was screened in the category "Blockbuster hits from around the world".[113]

The film was distributed in Tamil Nadu by Lyca Productions and Sri Lakshmi Movies, Swagath Enterprises in Karnataka[119] and by E4 Entertainments in Kerala.[120][121]

Home media
The film began streaming 21 days later through Amazon Prime Video on 7 January 2022, while the Hindi version began streaming from 14 January 2022.[122] The film was also released in Japanese Blu-ray version on 7 August 2024.[123]

Reception
Box office
On its opening day, Pushpa: The Rise netted ₹44 crore in India with a gross of around ₹53 crore, and set a post-pandemic record for day one.[147] Including the premieres, the film grossed $850,000 in the United States and obtained a worldwide gross of ₹74 crore on its first day.[148] Pushpa grossed over ₹161 crore worldwide in its opening weekend.[149] It netted over ₹107.5 crore in three days, making it the first ₹100 crore weekend in India post-COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, it is the 13th film and fourth South Indian film to achieve this feat. Box Office India reported that the opening would have been higher, if not for the ticket pricing issue in Andhra Pradesh state.[150] An article from The Indian Express analysed the losses incurred by The Rise due to low ticket prices in Andhra. "Pushpa collected a [distributor's] share of a little more than ₹13 crore from the state's 1100 screens. To put this in perspective, in Telangana, the first-day share of Pushpa was pegged at over ₹11 crore from around 600-odd screens," the article stated.[151]

The film's Hindi dubbed version is commercially successful.[152] The Rise's Hindi version netted ₹26.50 crore in its first week,[153] and over ₹62 crore by the end of third weekend.[154] The Rise netted over ₹200 crore in India in two weeks, and became the seventh South India film and the second Allu Arjun film after Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020) to do so.[155] The film grossed ₹300 crore worldwide from all versions by the end of the third weekend, and emerged as the highest grossing Indian film in 2021.[156] The scale of the dub's commercial gains have been considered unusual, especially as the film was also available on streaming platforms during its Hindi theatrical run. Its success, as well as the popularity of other Telugu films dubbed into Hindi, has been mainly attributed to the film's mass appeal as a masala film during a time when Hindi cinema has focused more on realism and has become more "toned down".[157][158]

Plot
The plot revolves around Kathavaraayan "Raayan," a food-truck owner in North Chennai, and his close-knit family, consisting of his two younger brothers, Muthu and Manickam, and his sister, Durga. Raayan has been the caretaker of his siblings since childhood after their parents' disappearance. Muthu is a hot-headed alcoholic, while Manickam is a college student. Raayan is devoted to Durga and arranges her wedding, leading to financial strain.

Their lives take a dark turn when Muthu accidentally kills the son of a gangster, Durai, which drags Raayan and his family into a bloody gang war involving Durai's rival, Sethu. As Raayan refuses to side with Sethu, tensions escalate. Raayan and his brothers kill Durai, and Raayan becomes Sethu's main target. Meanwhile, Raayan’s financial struggles worsen as he prepares for Durga’s wedding, eventually selling his food truck and emptying his savings.

Things spiral further out of control when Durga is abducted and assaulted by Sethu’s henchmen, and Muthu and Manickam betray Raayan by joining Sethu. Raayan is severely injured, but Durga saves him, and they escape. In retaliation, Raayan kidnaps Sethu's wife and confronts the henchman responsible for Durga's assault, leading to the henchman's death. As Raayan plans his final confrontation, his brothers seek reconciliation, but Durga kills Manickam in revenge for his betrayal. In the final battle, Raayan kills Muthu, Sethu, and his gang.

In the end, Raayan declines a deal from a corrupt police officer, Sargunam, who had tried to manipulate both sides. Muthu’s lover, Meghalai, gives her child to Raayan and Durga, wanting to distance herself from Muthu’s bloodline. Raayan and Durga leave Chennai, seeking a peaceful life away from the violence.
